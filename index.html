			<h2 class="special">you have questions, we have answers</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column size-12">
					<h2>What is a hackathon? What are the basic time, location, and purpose details of HackHI?</h2>
					<p>
						A hackathon is an intensive software development event. Although hackathons take place for times ranging from a few hours to an entire week, the coding portion of HackHI will take place for <em>24 hours</em>. The program will begin at 8:00 a.m. on Friday, July 10 in the Digital Experience Center with registration, project idea brainstorming, and team formation. The hacking madness will then start at 10:00 a.m. and conclude promptly at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday, July 11. No - we won't let you go into overtime.
					</p>
					<p>
						Following the conclusion of the hackathon, there will be a presentation session where teams will present their (hopefully functional) <em>project demos</em> to all attendees. Projects will then be judged and prizes awarded. Please note that there will be a company-wide press release showcasing HackHI and all the presented projects.
					</p>
					<p>
						Aside from software development, HackHI will be focused upon being a fantastic and fast-paced educational networking environment. Hence, <strong>no matter your area of expertise, you should be there!</strong>
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column size-4">
					<h2>Do I have to be a Humana intern to attend?</h2>
					<p>
						To compete on a team you must be a Humana intern. However, all Humana associates will be welcomed with open arms to volunteer in some manner. If the interns desire successful projects, then the guidance from full-time associates is crucial! Come one, come all!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column size-4">
					<h2>I'm not exactly a very experienced programmer - should I still attend?</h2>
					<p>
						No sweat! We definitely want you there! All teams are composed only of interns with varying levels of experience and differing backgrounds of expertise. <strong>The main goal of HackHI is to be a learning experience and networking event for the interns; anyone can learn!</strong>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column size-4">
					<h2>How much does the event cost?</h2>
					<p>
						The greatest part of the event is that it's completely free to all Humana associates. Dinner on Friday night, Saturday breakfast and snacks will be provided. If you require more food than this, it is your responsibility.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column size-4">
					<h2>What should I bring?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since it is being held at a Humana location please make sure that you have your Badge.
                    </p>
					<p>
						We strongly recommend bringing a <strong>personal laptop</strong> (and charger!) with power stripes, and necessary accessories. Humana will not be able to provide powerstrips, it is very important that you bring one. If it is absolutely necessary for you to use a company laptop, please be aware of Humana laptop policies, as it will be impossible for you to download things you might need the day of the Hackathon (or at all). In addition, blankets, pillows, toothbrushes, snacks, and a change of comfy clothes are all suggested.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column size-4">
					<h2>Speaking of comfy clothes...am I allowed to dress casually the day of HackHI?</h2>
					<p>
						Since it is in the D.E.C. you are able to dress casually but remember it is still a Humana building so do not wear anything that might be considered inappropriate. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column size-4">
					<h2>Is there anything that I'm not allowed to bring?</h2>
					<p>
						You cannot bring a project you have started or any personal code to help you along the way. All project work must originate during the 24 hours of HackHI. Of course, anything that is open source is an encouraged starting point!
					</p>
                    <p>
                        Pretty much don't bring anything you wouldn't bring to a normal work day.
                    </p>
<!--
					<p>
						Also, clearly you must go through Humana security to reach the location of HackHI, so anything that wouldn't make it past them certainly is not permitted.
					</p>
-->
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column size-4">
					<h2>What can I work on during HackHI?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A Theme hasn't been decided yet but will soon. Check back to find out more.
                    </p>
<!--
					<p>
						The overall theme of HackHI relates back to Humana's overall value - <strong>wellness</strong>. The details of the project theme will be given on the morning of the Hackathon to prevent anxious programmers from getting a head-start.
					</p>
-->
				</div>
				<div class="column size-4">
					<h2>Can I work on a past project?</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>NO!</strong> There will be a theme to the projects, and to create a fair judging environment, we are not allowing anyone to work on past projects or work from old code.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column size-4">
					<h2>How are the teams going to be formed?</h2>
					<p>
						The teams will be formed on the day of the Hackathon. At the start of the day, interns will brainstorm ideas for projects. Once brainstorming is complete, teams will naturally form based on the similarity of project ideas.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column size-4">
					<h2>Do I really get the whole day off?</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Yes! Participants will be excused from working Friday.</strong> HackHI registration will start promptly at 8:00 a.m. and there is no requirement that you attend work beforehand. In fact, the HackHI team strongly encourages that you <em>sleep as much as possible before the event</em>!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column size-4">
					<h2>Are we really staying overnight?</h2>
					<p>
						Yup! Interns will continue coding through the night to perfect their projects. If one simply can't stay awake for 24 hours, it is possible to take a short cat nap right there at the event or even return to the Galt House for a solid rest. <!--<strong>Please keep in mind that if you decide to return to the Galt House or leave the D.E.C. for any reason you MUST return by passing through security. There will be <em>no exceptions</em>!</strong>--> In general, plan sleeping time wisely, so as not to let projects suffer.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column size-4">
					<h2>What are the prizes?</h2>
					<p>
						Prizes are currently TBD. However, this event is not about winning - its focus is upon learning and networking.
					</p>
